I'm best at being open to new ideas, to different types of people. Understanding different people in different situations and giving everyone the chance they deserve. 
I am good at staying positive and proactive. 
I can keep focused on the task and morale high. 
I always have time for people and I am able to keep calm within situations. 
I try my best all the time. 
I am always trying to improve myself.
I am capable.
I have a creative side, I have many skills and talents.
I love working with people.
I love working on challenging things.

I need to improve others aswell as myself. 
I need to maintain composure in all situations. 
I need to continue working on myself. 
I need to keep staying postive. 
I need to recognise that there is no competition, helping others will progress everyone forward including myself. 
This is the platform that I can create. Positive energy is paramount. 
I need to listen to everyone and take my time.
I need to meditate more.
I need to develop my personal life.

If I had no limits I would be a beacon of energy, of positivity, I would inspire others to work hard and to develop themselves. 
I would teach others everything that I know and learn from them in all ways possible.
I would be specific, sharp wit. Having an effect on things and people.
I would do everything for good, for the benefit of everyone.
I would push the boundaries of my own mind and intellect to limits unknown.
I would harness energy like a burning flame, that others could feel and experience purely by imagination alone.
I would feel like a god. And embrace that feeling, returning it to the world.
