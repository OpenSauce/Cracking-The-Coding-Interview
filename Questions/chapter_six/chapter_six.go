Question One

You increment the number of pills for each bottle, so if you have .7g higher you'd know it was the 7th bottle.

Question Two
Basketball

Winning game 1 = p

p * p * (1-p) + p * (1-p) * p + (1-p) * p * p
3 (1-p) p^2
3 (p^2 - p^3)
3p^2 - 3p^3
p^3 + 3p^2 - 3p^3
3p^2 - 2p^3
p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
1 > 3p - 2p^2
2p^2 - 3p + 1 > 0
(2p - 1)(p -1) > 0
